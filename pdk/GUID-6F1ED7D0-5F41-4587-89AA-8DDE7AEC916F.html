<li><p><strong>ScreenPlay, also known as the New Graphics Architecture
(NGA):</strong> This new graphics architecture enables device creators
to take advantage of improved software performance, hardware acceleration
and third party graphics engines. It makes it possible to combine
UI components, graphics and video to create highly innovative UIs.
For more information, see <a href="GUID-D93978BE-11A3-5CE3-B110-1DEAA5AD566C.html" title="This topic provides an introduction to ScreenPlay and its architecture.

ScreenPlay is sometimes known as the New Graphics Architecture (NGA).">The ScreenPlay Graphics
Architecture</a>.</p>

<li><p><strong>Extended Bitmaps:</strong> The Font and Bitmap Server provides a framework for device creators
to add support for their own types of bitmap compression. Bitmaps
that use compression formats that are provided by device creators
are known as extended bitmaps.

<li><p><strong>Dynamic Direct Screen
Access (DSA) Allocation:</strong> The Symbian platform now supports the
dynamic allocation of the DSA buffer. For more information, see <a href="GUID-8DF46A11-874A-52E5-9298-C083EA633BA0.html" title="This topic describes how device creators can allocate the Direct Screen Access (DSA) buffer dynamically. This feature is new in Symbian^3 (S^3).">Implementing Dynamic
DSA Allocation</a>.</p>
</li>

<li><p><strong>Multiple Touch Support:</strong> The ScreenPlay version of the
Window Server has been extended to support multiple advanced pointers,
with support for proximity and pressure. The emulator now also supports
multiple advanced pointers. For more information, see <a href="GUID-A12A66ED-2C8F-5CE6-8F3E-332B045A35B4.html" title="In ScreenPlay, the Window Server provides advanced pointer features, such as support for multiple pointers and proximity and pressure coordinates.">Advanced Pointers</a>.</p>
</li>


<li><p><strong>Enhanced Touch UI:</strong> The touch UI includes the following
improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Multi-page Home Screen enables the user to navigate between
widgets with a simple flick gesture</p>
</li>

<li><p>Capacitive multiple touch events are supported.</p>
</li>

<li><p>Tactile Feedback utilizes advanced haptics effects.</p>

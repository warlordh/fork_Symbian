<div><p>This document describes the fair scheduling and file caching features
of the File Server.</p>

current design of the file server supports the processing of client requests
concurrently, as long as those requests are made to different drives in the
system. For example, a read operation may take place on the NAND user area
partition while a write operation to the MMC card takes place concurrently. </p>
<p>However,
requests to the same drive are serialized on a first-come first-served basis,
which under some circumstances leads to bad user experience. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li id="GUID-5B24741C-7CE0-58E8-98C9-1D1CACCD476F__GUID-6550B420-5545-42C9-B304-9A8FA7D9DA01"><a name="GUID-5B24741C-7CE0-58E8-98C9-1D1CACCD476F__GUID-6550B420-5545-42C9-B304-9A8FA7D9DA01"><!-- --></a><p>An incoming call arrives
while a large video file is being written to the NAND user area by an application
that writes the file in very large chunks.</p>
</li>

<li id="GUID-5B24741C-7CE0-58E8-98C9-1D1CACCD476F__GUID-7B08B626-E610-448B-917C-CB6CC127F2B9"><a name="GUID-5B24741C-7CE0-58E8-98C9-1D1CACCD476F__GUID-7B08B626-E610-448B-917C-CB6CC127F2B9"><!-- --></a><p>In order to display
the caller’s details, the phone needs to read from the contacts database which
is also stored on the NAND user area.</p>
</li>

takes a very long time to complete, so the call is lost.</p>
</li>

</ol>
<p> This is one of many scenarios where the single threaded nature of
the file server may lead to unresponsive behavior. In order to improve the
responsiveness of the system, the Symbian platform implements a fair scheduling
policy that splits up large requests into more manageable chunks, thus providing
clients of the file server with a more responsive system when the file server
is under heavy load.</p>

performance by addressing the following use case: <ul>
<li><p>A client (or multiple clients) issues repeated requests to read data
from the same locality within a file. Data that was previously read (and is
still in the cache) can be returned to the client without continuously re-reading
the data from the media. </p>
</li>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Read caching is of little benefit for clients/files that are
typically accessed sequentially in large blocks and never re-read.</div>
<p>There
may be a small degradation in performance on some media due to the overhead
of copying the data from the media into the file cache. To some extent this
may be mitigated by the affects of read-ahead, but this clearly does not affect
large (&gt;= 4K) reads and/or non-sequential reads. It should also be noted that
any degradation may be more significant for media where the read is entirely
synchronous (for example, NAND on the H4 HRP), because there is no scope for
a read-ahead to be running in the file server drive thread at the same time
as reads are being satisfied in the context of the file server’s main thread.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="GUID-5B24741C-7CE0-58E8-98C9-1D1CACCD476F__GUID-7C6E6FDB-1419-4A8E-82F8-74EE6E62D468"><a name="GUID-5B24741C-7CE0-58E8-98C9-1D1CACCD476F__GUID-7C6E6FDB-1419-4A8E-82F8-74EE6E62D468"><!-- --></a><h2 class="sectiontitle">Demand paging effects</h2><p>When ROM paging is enabled,
the kernel maintains a <em>live list</em> of pages that are currently being
used to store demand paged content. It is important to realize that this list
also contains non-dirty pages belonging to the file cache. The implication
of this is that reading some data into the file cache, or reading data already
stored in the file cache, may result in code pages being evicted from the
live list. </p>
<p>Having a large number of clients reading through
or from the file cache can have an adverse effect on performance. For this
reason it is probably not a good idea to set the <a href="GUID-3B777E89-8E4C-3540-958F-C621741895C8.html"><span class="apiname">FileCacheSize</span></a> property
to too large a value – otherwise a single application reading a single large
file through the cache is more likely to cause code page evictions if the
amount of available RAM is restricted. See <a href="GUID-EB2566BD-8F65-5A81-B215-E8B05CFE21C3.html" title="Describes how to change media drivers when demand paging is used.">Migration
Tutorial: Demand Paging and Media Drivers</a>.</p>

(particularly using small block lengths) impact system performance due to
the overhead in requesting data from the media. Read-ahead caching addresses
this issue by ensuring that subsequent small read operations may be satisfied
from the cache after issuing a large request to read ahead data from the media.</p>
<p>Read-ahead
caching builds on read caching by detecting clients that are performing streaming
operations and speculatively reading ahead on the assumption that once the
data is in the cache it is likely to be accessed in the near future, thus
improving performance.</p>
<p>The number of bytes requested by the read-ahead
mechanism is initially equal to double the client’s last read length or a
page, for example, 4K (whichever is greater) and doubles each time the file
server detects that the client is due to read outside of the extents of the
read-ahead cache, up to a pre-defined maximum (128K). </p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="GUID-5B24741C-7CE0-58E8-98C9-1D1CACCD476F__GUID-976EE014-E3C3-42FD-8467-1D008DEC27FD"><a name="GUID-5B24741C-7CE0-58E8-98C9-1D1CACCD476F__GUID-976EE014-E3C3-42FD-8467-1D008DEC27FD"><!-- --></a><h2 class="sectiontitle">Write caching</h2><p>Write caching is implemented to perform
a small level of write-back caching. This overcomes inefficiencies of clients
that perform small write operations, thus taking advantage of media that is
written on a block basis by consolidating multiple file updates into a single
larger write as well as minimizing the overhead of metadata updates that the
file system performs. </p>
<p>By implementing write back at the file level,
rather than at the level of the block device, the possibility of file system
corruption is removed as the robustness features provided by rugged FAT and
LFFS are still applicable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, by disabling write back by default,
allowing the licensee to specify the policy on a per drive basis, providing
APIs on a per session basis and respecting Flush and Close operations, the
risk of data corruption is minimized.</p>
<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The possibility of data loss
increases, but the LFFS file system already implements a simple write back
cache of 4K in size so the impact of this should be minimal.</div>
<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Write
caching must be handled with care, as this could potentially result in loss
of user data.</div>
<p>Database access needs special consideration as corruption
may occur if the database is written to expect write operations to be committed
to disk immediately or in a certain order (write caching may re-order write
requests).</p>
<p>For these reasons, it is probably safer to leave write caching
off by default and to consider enabling it on a per-application basis. See <a href="GUID-89BCF9A5-ABBD-5523-BA76-FDB00B806A30.html#GUID-89BCF9A5-ABBD-5523-BA76-FDB00B806A30__GUID-719C7E0C-790B-5C61-9EA8-E2687397340F">Enabling

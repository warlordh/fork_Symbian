breaks and deprecated functionality</h2><p>On ScreenPlay, support
for direct screen access (DSA) is maintained for backward compatibility
reasons, although Symbian recommends the use of external surfaces
in preference to DSA. However, whereas on some earlier
devices, applications might work without fully conforming to the rules
of DSA, these rules are now necessarily enforced.

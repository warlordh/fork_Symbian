<h1 class="topictitle1">Screen Driver Component</h1>
<div><p>The Screen Driver component is an adaptation component, which means that it can be adapted or replaced by device creators to suit the exact hardware. Screen Driver was originally designed to provide low-level bitmap manipulation functionality and platform-independent access to platform-specific graphics display and hardware acceleration technology. However, ScreenPlay has introduced a new graphics architecture that has been designed from the ground up to support graphic acceleration hardware. This means that the role of the Screen Driver varies in the ScreenPlay and non-ScreenPlay variants. In a ScreenPlay device, it is usually possible to use the Symbian Screen Driver implementation without modification.</p>

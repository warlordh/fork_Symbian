In general, back up as much private data as possible. The following data is usually not backed up: </p>
 <ul><li id="GUID-77E6748E-F9A8-531A-9203-EC11A3E53073__GUID-81BE43E0-8408-501A-AF67-21D8B67E3F3F"><a name="GUID-77E6748E-F9A8-531A-9203-EC11A3E53073__GUID-81BE43E0-8408-501A-AF67-21D8B67E3F3F"><!-- --></a><p>If the private data must not be exposed to the user, it must not be backed up. Assume that all data backed up can be read and potentially altered by the user. This might change if a device creator implements encryption which does not rely on keys provided by the user but that is a device creator-specific decision and cannot be guaranteed. </p>
 </li>
 <li id="GUID-77E6748E-F9A8-531A-9203-EC11A3E53073__GUID-68CD4502-AE73-560D-BED3-6B42A31A91B9"><a name="GUID-77E6748E-F9A8-531A-9203-EC11A3E53073__GUID-68CD4502-AE73-560D-BED3-6B42A31A91B9"><!-- --></a><p>If the process cannot keep the private data stable during a backup or restore, they cannot safely back it up. This is a poor reason for not backing up data but may be a practical one. It depends on the sources of external events and whether they can be delayed or placed in a temporary location. </p>
 </li>
 <li id="GUID-77E6748E-F9A8-531A-9203-EC11A3E53073__GUID-4413CA48-134C-5AA0-B5B1-B80B0EF9AFE3"><a name="GUID-77E6748E-F9A8-531A-9203-EC11A3E53073__GUID-4413CA48-134C-5AA0-B5B1-B80B0EF9AFE3"><!-- --></a><p>If the private data can be easily recreated by other means, it may be excluded. This may not be a good criteria, but if a process would find it difficult to back up private data (perhaps for the reasons above) and the data could easily be created (for example by receiving configuration messages), choosing not to back it up may be more acceptable. </p>
 </li>
 </ul>
 <p>In addition, consider the implications on other processes of backing up the data or not. If your data must remain consistent with that in public files, the private data must be backed up. If your data must remain consistent with that owned by another process, either both or neither should back up data. </p>

It also takes less system resources because processes taking part in active backup must be running during a backup or restore. However, active backup allows the data-owning process more control over the data and this can have both security and performance gains. </p>
 <p>The choice between passive and active backup involves weighing up a number of factors. The following list includes a range of advantages and disadvantages and you need to consider all of these and make a decision. </p>
 <ul><li id="GUID-77E6748E-F9A8-531A-9203-EC11A3E53073__GUID-BF488563-549B-5352-8AA5-D7A4E762DC85"><a name="GUID-77E6748E-F9A8-531A-9203-EC11A3E53073__GUID-BF488563-549B-5352-8AA5-D7A4E762DC85"><!-- --></a><p>The registration for passive data backup only specifies whole files or directories. It is not possible to backup only part of a file using passive backup. If you need to backup only part of a file you need to either split the file into two or use active backup. </p>
 </li>
 <li id="GUID-77E6748E-F9A8-531A-9203-EC11A3E53073__GUID-A2610862-C4D4-529B-B665-B54E1C317894"><a name="GUID-77E6748E-F9A8-531A-9203-EC11A3E53073__GUID-A2610862-C4D4-529B-B665-B54E1C317894"><!-- --></a><p>The backup registration file that defines the files and directories to be subject to passive backup is created at system build time (for a system process) or at installation time (for an installed application). The backup registration files cannot be modified or created at runtime. If your process creates new directories after installation, the backup registration file cannot be extended for these. If you want these backed up, you need to put them under a common directory which all gets backed up or use active backup and make a run-time decision on what to backup. This aspect may be partially or wholly addressed by installing additional backup registration files. </p>
 </li>
 <li id="GUID-77E6748E-F9A8-531A-9203-EC11A3E53073__GUID-560410E9-3A5C-5905-AE6F-7EE0E37DDECD"><a name="GUID-77E6748E-F9A8-531A-9203-EC11A3E53073__GUID-560410E9-3A5C-5905-AE6F-7EE0E37DDECD"><!-- --></a><p>Backed up data is compressed to speed up data transfer which can be disabled. If your private data has a specific format and you can manage to backup only a fraction of it you may be able to make the backup of your data more efficient by implementing active backup. </p>
 </li>
 <li id="GUID-77E6748E-F9A8-531A-9203-EC11A3E53073__GUID-82758AB6-DEF9-57A0-85F1-06645F152BD2"><a name="GUID-77E6748E-F9A8-531A-9203-EC11A3E53073__GUID-82758AB6-DEF9-57A0-85F1-06645F152BD2"><!-- --></a><p>Backups can be base backups or incremental backups. With passive backup (as with the backing up of public files) incremental backups include all relevant files which have changed or are new since the last backup took place. If a file contains record-based data (such as a database), the addition or changing of one record will cause the whole file to require backup. If you implement active backup, you could only backup the changed or new records (plus recording deleted records in some way). This could increase the performance of backup and restore for your data. </p>
 </li>
 <li id="GUID-77E6748E-F9A8-531A-9203-EC11A3E53073__GUID-3ACF99DB-CF34-549B-92A6-FC4FD18F233D"><a name="GUID-77E6748E-F9A8-531A-9203-EC11A3E53073__GUID-3ACF99DB-CF34-549B-92A6-FC4FD18F233D"><!-- --></a><p>Active backup requires your process to be started during a backup or restore operation. Your process will be started automatically as required by the Backup Engine if not already running. If your process normally runs at all times, this imposes no additional burden on the phone. However, if your process is not normally running, it will require additional resources during a backup or restore and you should consider if the benefits of active backup justify the additional burden. </p>
 </li>
 </ul>
 <p>A hybrid approach may be useful. The Backup Engine allows a data owner to register as both an <a href="GUID-743D2832-E73A-5184-A85D-306B2A6FFACC.html">active backup client</a> and a passive backup client. This was originally intended to allow a data owner to back up some data in each way but an alternative use is for the active backup client to prepare data for backup and then let the Backup Engine handle the actual transfer as a passive backup. The active backup client does not need to actually provide any data. </p>
 <p>In order to support this, the Backup Engine must not retrieve data for passive backup until an active backup client has signaled that the data is ready. This set-up is configurable in the backup registration file. That is, if a data owner is registered to take part in both passive and active backup, the PC host or other client is expected to request active backup data before passive backup data. </p>
 <p>When a restore operation is carried out, the data will be restored as passive data and the data owner is responsible for dealing with it when the restore operation is complete. In order to support this, the PC host or other client is expected to restore passively backed up data before actively backed up data if a data owner has registered for both active and passive backup and restore. </p>

 <p>If an application is designed for separate installation compared to upgrade, it needs to copy a backup registration file into the private directory during installation. If an application is part of the platform, this involves creating a backup registration file as part of the build and ensuring that it is located in the relevant private directory. </p>
 <p>In addition, the process must subscribe to the backup status flag described in <a href="GUID-88A5F321-17BA-566B-B025-22DB11664E54.html" title="This section describes the subscribe and publish flag for backup and restore.">Public and Subscribe Event for Active Backup</a> in order to detect when a backup or restore takes place. Processes which own private data that needs to be actively backed up are started up if required by the Backup Engine in order to do the backup or restore. Therefore, they must check the backup flag on startup rather than making a normal startup. This may involve undesirable access to other servers and files. </p>

 <p>If an application is designed for separate installation (as opposed to upgrade) it will need to copy a backup registration file into the private directory during installation. If an application is part of the platform, this involves creating a backup registration file as part of the build and ensuring that it is located in the relevant private directory.

In this scenario, data from each data cage must be backed up. The data owner holding data on behalf of another data owner is known as a proxy. From the PC’s point of view, this data belongs to the data owner, but internally the data is being requested from the proxy via the active client interface. A data owner requiring data from one of these proxies must specify the proxy in the element <samp class="codeph">&lt;proxy_data_manager /&gt;</samp> using its secure ID. See the example in <a href="GUID-9A6273D8-7797-5190-AFEC-1AD113980B84.html#GUID-9A6273D8-7797-5190-AFEC-1AD113980B84__GUID-EC5C504C-6901-5E05-A4B8-6304B2E39539">Backup Registration Files</a>. </p>
 <p> <em>Note: During a backup or restore operation, the data owner will behave as an active data owner as far as the PC is concerned, although this requires no special action on behalf of the data owner itself.</em>  </p>
 <p>Data stored in the central repository (CentRep) will be backed up if the proxy data manager tag is selected in the backup registration file specifying the central repository’s secure ID. Not all data may be backed up. Each value in CentRep has some metadata associated with it and one bit of the metadata is a backup flag. The value will be backed up only if the backup flag bit is set. It is the responsibility of the data owner to specify the correct settings within the repository initialization file. </p>
 <p>CentRep backups are always base, as opposed to incremental, because the CentRep does not contain sufficient information to efficiently support incremental backups and because CentRep data is not expected to be sufficiently large to justify incremental backup. </p>

between framework and applications</h1>

<p>The displays and keys for the mobile device are shared between all running
applications. The Symbian platform controls and coordinates access to them.
When you meet the <a href="Chunk750111890.html">application
framework architecture</a> requirements, the application framework manages
connections to the underlying architecture and also controls some of the elements
on the display. While the details of what is controlled by default by the
Symbian platform and what is controlled by your application are covered in
the relevant sections of this UI section, the following cases illustrate some
divisions about what is managed where: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>in the status pane: </p>


<p>The drawing of the status pane is managed by the Symbian platform.</p>

<p>The <em>battery pane</em>, <em>universal indicator pane</em>and <em>signal
pane</em> are managed by the Symbian platform.</p>

<p>The <em>title pane</em>, <em>context pane,</em> and <em>navi pane</em> are
managed by your application, although a default behavior is provided by the
application framework.</p>


</li>

<li><p>in the control pane:</p>


<p>The drawing of the control pane is managed by the Symbian platform.</p>

<p>The labels associated with the two softkeys are provided by application
resources.</p>

<p>The event loop that collects the commands that result from selections
and the passing of these commands on to your application are handled by the
application framework.</p>

<p>The <a href="Chunk126224768.html">handling
of the commands</a> received from the application framework need to be
handled in your application.</p>

<p>For more details, see <a href="Chunk256935172.html">CBA buttons</a> and <a href="Chunk2010698482.html">Menu bars</a>.</p>

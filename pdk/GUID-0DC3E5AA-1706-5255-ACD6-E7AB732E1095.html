ScreenPlay is a new graphics architecture, introduced in Symbian^3 (S^3). ScreenPlay enables device creators to take advantage of improved software performance, hardware acceleration and third party graphics engines. ScreenPlay is sometimes known as the New Graphics Architecture (NGA).">ScreenPlay</a>, composition is the process of combining content, possibly from several different sources, before it is displayed. For example, the following figure represents a scenario where content from the camera viewfinder, video, and OpenVG 2D and OpenGL ES 3D games are brought together with the UI content and then displayed on the screen. This process of bringing the content together is called <strong>composition</strong>. Some of the incoming content may be produced by hardware renderers and the composition itself may be hardware accelerated. </p>

 <p>In ScreenPlay, sources that generate complex graphical output (such as the camera viewfinder, video, and OpenGLES and OpenVG games) can render directly to <strong>composition surfaces</strong>. These are essentially pixel buffers with associated metadata describing the width, height, stride and pixel format. In the Symbian implementation, surfaces are implemented using <a href="GUID-51514A4B-0220-557B-9F7A-FB110CEFEF10.html" title="A shared chunk is a mechanism that kernel-side code uses to share memory buffers safely with user-side code.">shared chunks</a>, which are memory regions that can be safely shared between user-side and kernel-side processes. </p>
 <p>The Window Server's render stage plug-ins render all of the UI content onto a special surface that is known as the <strong>UI surface</strong>. This is semi-transparent—unlike the background surfaces, which are opaque. The following diagram shows the composition engine bringing together the UI surface and the background surfaces onto the frame buffer, which the Display Driver then displays on the screen. </p>

 <p>The composition engine maintains a stack of <strong>scene elements</strong> or layers (which describe the geometric positions, size and orientation), computes what is visible and performs the actual composition work. </p>

 <p>Here we will look briefly at the role of the key components. </p>
 <ul><li id="GUID-0DC3E5AA-1706-5255-ACD6-E7AB732E1095__GUID-635A150F-3298-578B-BE21-53255CB55235"><a name="GUID-0DC3E5AA-1706-5255-ACD6-E7AB732E1095__GUID-635A150F-3298-578B-BE21-53255CB55235"><!-- --></a><p>The composition engine maintains the stack of elements and computes what is visible. For example, it culls invisible areas and maintains a list of dirty rectangles. The composition engine also performs the actual composition work, blending the pixels if necessary. It supports limited transformation, such as scaling and rotation (in 90° increments). It can utilize GPU hardware composition and LCD hardware rotation if they are available. The Symbian Foundation provides a reference implementation based on the <a href="GUID-3B9AC7E9-3133-505F-9C1E-EB4BB4969838.html" title="The OpenWF Composition Interface Component provides the Symbian platform with a consistent interface to the open-source, cross-platform OpenWF Composition (OpenWF-C) APIs defined by the Khronos Group.

As mentioned above, in the Symbian implementation, surfaces are implemented as shared chunks because they must be accessible by user-side processes and the kernel and composition hardware. Because shared chunks can only be allocated on the kernel side, the Surface Manager is a logical device driver (LDD) and kernel extension. Surfaces can be multi-buffered and are identified by a 128 bit identifier (called the surface ID). </p>

When one of the stakeholders does something to the surface, it usually means that another stakeholder needs to do something too. The Surface Update component provides a channel for the stakeholders to inform each other of changes.">Surface Update Server</a> provides a communication mechanism between the composition engine and its clients. This is particularly useful for clients (such as video) that produce fast updates and use multi-buffered surfaces. The Surface Update Server sends back to the client notification of which surface and which buffer within a multi-buffered surface was used for the last composition operation. The client can then start updating the buffer without risk of tearing or artefacts. </p>

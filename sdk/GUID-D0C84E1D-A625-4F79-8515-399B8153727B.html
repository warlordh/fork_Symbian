       Interface
breaks and deprecated functionality
      </h2>
      <p>
       On ScreenPlay, support
for direct screen access (DSA) is maintained for backward compatibility
reasons, although Symbian recommends the use of external surfaces
in preference to DSA. However, whereas on some earlier
devices, applications might work without fully conforming to the rules
of DSA, these rules are now necessarily enforced. See
       <a href="GUID-3F0FCBB5-98D2-4355-96E3-2DA938DE1C16.html" title="This migration guide explains the guidelines that applications that use direct screen access (DSA) must follow in order to run on ScreenPlay (NGA) devices.">

       for information about the guidelines applications must follow in
order to be able to run correctly on a ScreenPlay device.

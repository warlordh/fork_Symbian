      A font is a set of characters of matching size (height) and appearance.
In order to be displayed each character must ultimately be drawn as a series
of pixels (a bitmap). Symbian can store fonts in bitmap or vector form. A
vector font (for example, an OpenType font) must be converted to bitmaps (or
rasterized) before it can be drawn. Symbian caches and shares bitmaps for
performance and memory efficiency.

         Typefaces are grouped
generically as mono-spaced, variable width, serif, sans-serif and symbol.
This allows the grouping of typefaces that have similar characteristics, so
that an alternative font can be selected when an exact match is not found.
This means that applications can display text relatively accurately when a
specific font is not available.

        Contextual shaping
       </dt>
       <dd>
        <p>
         In some scripts some characters are drawn differently depending on
the adjacent characters. This means that different glyphs are used to represent
a particular character in different contexts. Contextual shaping is the selection
of the appropriate glyph from several glyphs that represent a particular character
depending on the context.
        </p>
        <p>
         In Latin scripts, contextual shaping is
normally used only when simulating handwriting. For example, the glyph used
for the letter
         <strong>
          p
         </strong>
         might depend on whether the letter is at the start,
middle or end of a word, as shown in the following diagram. For example, when
it is in the middle of the word, it might have a "tail" on both sides to join
it to the letters that appear before and after.

The Font and Bitmap Server ensures that there is only ever a single instance

required to render them. The Font Store loads font files when the phone starts
up. It scans all of the drives on the device so that new fonts can be installed
from user drives. Font files can be loaded by the Font Store while the phone
is running. However, font rasterizers can only be installed by restarting
the phone. If a new font requires a font rasterizer to be installed, the phone
must be restarted before the font can be used.

       Open font rasterizers
are implemented as ECOM plug-ins. An open font file (represented by

can contain one or more open fonts in proprietary vector format. A corresponding
font rasterizer plug-in (

        <span class="apiname">
         COpenFontRasterizer

       </a>
       ) must convert
the vector data into bitmaps that the Font and Bitmap Server can cache and
access using the

exactly the same way as native bitmap fonts. The open font framework means
that Symbian can support any font in any format. There is a performance impact
associated with open fonts, however, as they must be rasterized.

       : The
       iType
Font Rasterizer
       is an OpenType font rasterizer from MonoType ImagingÂ®.
This provides additional features compared to the FreeType font rasterizer,
such as four color blending, which is required for outline and shadow fonts.
This component is not provided by the Symbian Foundation because it belongs
to Monotype. However, the Symbian platform has test cases for the four color
blending that the iType Font Rasterizer provides. These test cases can be
used by device creators who obtain this font rasterizer from MonoType.

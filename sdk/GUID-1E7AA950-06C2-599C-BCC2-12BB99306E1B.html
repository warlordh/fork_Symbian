       1 Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
       A
platform security model was introduced in Symbian OS v9. Developers can read
this paper to get a high level view of the model and what it means for how
they implement programs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some brief background information about security
and mobile phones is provided in section 2. The document does not describe
what infrastructure is needed to support the security model in the operating
system, such as application signing programs, security incident processes,

       2 Symbian Platform
Security Background
      </h2>
      <p>
       Symbian platform security covers the philosophy,
architecture and implementation of the platform defence mechanisms against
malicious or badly implemented code. The scope of platform security requires
a holistic perspective of some complex system services and their interactions.
This paper focuses on the architectural elements required to support the platform
defence mechanisms. Specifically, we examine a number of architectural countermeasures
that collectively constitute the
       <strong>
        Symbian Platform Security Architecture
       </strong>
       .
We also look at the substantial number of issues that the adoption of such
platform security architecture poses.

Symbian Security Policy Requirements

      </p>
      <p>
       A security policy allows
you to determine effective countermeasures to threats in three ways: protection,
detection and reaction. These three aspects need to be enforced by different
mechanisms that are outlined in the following subsections.

        2.1.1
Prevention
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a need to prevent badly written applications
from doing things they are not intended to do on the platform. This involves
first of all determining whether the application is sufficiently trustworthy
to be installed and then subsequently protecting the platform from errant
behaviour once it is installed. In terms of determining trust, third party
applications are categorised according to the degree of trust associated with
their authors. The binding between trust and authorship is encapsulated within
digital certificates issued by a Certificate Authority (CA). The CA performs
a role within a PKI which is the organisational infrastructure used to establish
and mediate the trust relationships. Individual third party applications are
furthermore granted differing degrees of capability at install time within
the context of the platform environment on the basis of the perceived degree
of trust bestowed upon them by the PKI.
      </p>
      <p>
       As said in [4],
       <em>
        mandatory
security mechanisms may be used both to limit trusted applications to the
minimal set of privileges required for their function and to confine the damage
caused by any misuse of their privileges
       </em>
       . For this reason it is important
to understand that the security architecture must be also applied to Symbian
and licensees code even on a closed environment where new code cannot be installed.
As for the MMU (Memory Management Unit) it will bring us several benefits
like decreasing the impact of a flaw, enforcing good design and reducing dependencies
between components.

Detection
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The detection of errant application behaviour on the
platform includes ensuring that incidents are logged and reported promptly.
This means continuous monitoring of relevant incident tracking sources and
first level categorisation of security breaches as being minor, significant
or major. It may also include support of intrusion detection systems on the
platform such as virus scanners. Detection also covers tracking the security
flaws in standards we implement as well as security flaws in the platform
security architecture. Finally it involves the detection of compromises in
the public key infrastructure supporting application signing programs.

      <p>
       There
is a need to respond to incidents promptly and effectively. The consequence
of having no coherent response to major incidents may be a catastrophic loss
of confidence in the security of the Symbian platform among our customers
and users. Even if the full response mechanism is out of the scope of the
Symbian platform, the security architecture should provide support to implement
part of it as capability revocation and upgrade mechanisms.

The Security Architecture
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The main security threat Symbian addresses
with this platform security architecture is to prevent viral distribution
of malicious applications; for this reason hardware attacks are not specifically
addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The architecture focuses in delivering prevention mechanisms.
Detections and reactions rely heavily on services provided by an infrastructure
external to the phone and its operating system and are not addressed in this
document. The basic outline of the security architecture is analogue to a
medieval castle defences. In a similar fashion it employs simple and staggered
layers of security above and beyond the software installer perimeter. The
key threats that the model is trying to address are those that are linked
with unauthorised access to user data and to system services in particular
the phone stack. The phone stack is especially important in the context of
a phone because it will be controlling a permanent data connection to the
Internet. There are two key design drivers lying behind the model:

       There is a certain minimum amount of architectural work that had
to be done to put the security architecture in place. However, there was also
a requirement to minimise the impact of any scheme to the architecture of
the Symbian platform. Adding platform security with minimal impact was hard
to do but this desire had influenced a lot of the architectural ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       On
the plus side, the security architecture has some distinct advantages over
other approaches. It offers us the chance to get a competitive advantage by
putting in place the right security architecture for a phone platform. This
in turn would mean that our licensees would see the Symbian platform as a
more attractive option than the competition partly because the premiums they
would have to pay for device security insurance would be lower. In addition,
they will have increased trust that deployment of the Symbian platform in
their products will not ruin their reputation and brand.
      </p>
      <p>
       All these
points should be borne in mind as we move on to detail the architectural aspects
of the model in the next section.

Architectural Countermeasures

      <p>
       It is inherently difficult to work
out how to partition a holistic architecture such as that required to support
platform wide security. The approach we have taken here is to present a series
of different views on the architectural countermeasures from various perspectives
each of which highlight a particular functional element within the system.
The security architecture is a combination of these elements.

Trusted Computing Base
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       A trusted computing base is a basic architectural
requirement for robust platform security. The trusted computing base would
consist of a number of architectural elements that cannot be subverted and
that guarantee the integrity of the device. It is important to keep this base
as small as possible and to apply the principle of least privilege to ensure
system servers and applications do not have to be given privileges they do
not need to function. On closed devices, the TCB consists of the Symbian platform
kernel and F32, on open devices the software installer (SWInstall) is also
required. All these processes are system-wide trusted and have therefore full
access to the device. This trusted core would run with a “Tcb” system capability
not available to other platform code.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is one other important
element of the trusted computing base, namely the hardware. One important
recent paper [6] has outlined a hardware design that does not take operating
system security into account. In particular, with devices that hold trusted
computing base functionality in flash ROM, it is necessary to provide a secure
boot loader to ensure that it is not possible to subvert the trusted computing
base with a malicious ROM image. Providing such a secure boot loader is explicitly
excluded from the scope of this architecture, and it is a requirement on the
base port for specific hardware platforms to provide for this.

        “There are always system components
&lt;…&gt; that must be able to read and write at all levels &lt;…&gt;. The practical
outcome is that an uncomfortably large part of the operating system (plus
utilities, plus windowing system, plus database) often ends up in the trusted

       Beyond the core, other system components
are granted restricted orthogonal system capability and constitute the Trusted
Computing Environment, for instance, these include servers providing sockets,
telephony, certificate management, database access, and windowing services.
Each server just has the capabilities it requires, for instance the windowing
server is not granted phone stack access and the communications servers is
not granted direct access to keyboard events. These system capabilities are
only available to third party code that is appropriately signed. By limiting
the number and combination of system capabilities allocated to any single
component, a limit is placed on the potential damage that can be caused by
any vulnerability or misuse of privileges.

Process Capabilities

      </p>
      <p>
       A capability is an access token that corresponds
to a permission to undertake a sensitive action or group of actions. The Symbian
platform security architecture purpose is to control access to sensitive system
resources. The most important resource that requires access control is the
kernel executive itself and a
       <em>
        system
       </em>
       capability is required by a client
to access certain functionality through the kernel API. All other resources
reside in user-side servers accessed via inter-process communication (IPC)
(eg. the telephony server). A limited number of basic capabilities are defined
to police specific client actions on the servers. For example, possession
of the “network services” capability allows a client to place phone calls
via the telephony server. It is the responsibility of the server to police
client access to the resources that it provides.

         Capabilities are associated
with processes not threads. Threads in the same process share the same address
space and memory access permissions. This means that any data being used by
one thread can be read and modified by all other threads in the same process.
In addition, threads in the same process can write to each other’s stacks
and thereby divert one another’s execution path.

         The only cryptography
involved in this scheme is at the software installation stage where certificates
are checked off against the appropriate root certificates, if necessary, before
code is granted any requested capabilities. In some scenarios it is possible
for third party developers to dispense with the use of certificates altogether,
in which case users would be responsible for granting the requisite capabilities.

Mapping real-world permissions – User Capabilities
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The process
of identified these capabilities was a lengthy and involved one. First we
attempted to identify those accesses that require policing and then tried
to map those requirements into something that is meaningful for a user. In
addition, more capabilities means greater complexity and complexity is widely
recognised as being the chief enemy of security. A solution based on capabilities
should therefore seek to minimise the overall number deployed. These map fairly
broadly onto the main threats which are unauthorised access to the outside
world and preserving the confidentiality/integrity of user data. We assert
that any permission requirement can be expressed in terms of some combination
of those. In a sense, these capabilities represent orthogonal groupings because
they police different kinds of access together. The capabilities identified
today are as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        NetworkServices
       </strong>
       <strong>
       </strong>
       Grants
access to remote services without any restriction on its physical location.
Typically, this location is unknown to the phone user. Also such services
may incur cost for the phone user. This typically implies routed protocols.
Voice calls, SMS, internet services are good examples of such network services.
They are supported by GSM, CDMA and all IP transport protocols including Bluetooth
profiles over IP.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        LocalServices
       </strong>
       <strong>
       </strong>
       Grants access
to remote services in the close vicinity of the phone. The location of the
remote service is well-known to the phone user.In most cases, such services
will not incur cost for the phone user. This typically implies a non-routed
protocol. An application with this capability can normally send or receive
information through Serial port, USB, IR and point-to-point Bluetooth profiles.
Examples of services are IR beaming with the user's PC, Bluetooth gaming,
file transfer.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        ReadUserData
       </strong>
       Grants read access to data belonging
to the phone user. This capability supports the
       <em>
        confidentiality
       </em>
       of
       <em>
       </em>
       user
data. Today, Contacts, messages and calendar data are always seen as user
confidential data. For other content types such as images or sounds, it may
depend on context, and ultimately be up to the application owning the data
to define.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        WriteUserData
       </strong>
       Grants write access to user data.
This capability supports the management of the
       <em>
        integrity
       </em>
       of user data.
Note that this capability is not necessarily symmetric with ReadUserData.
For instance, one may wish to prevent rogue applications from deleting music
tracks but may not wish to restrict read access to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Location
       </strong>
       Grants
access to the live location of the device. This capability supports the management
of user’s privacy regarding the phone location. Location information protected
by this capability can include map co-ordinates and street address, but not
regional or national scale information.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        UserEnvironment
       </strong>
       Grants
access to live confidential information about the user and his/her immediate
environment.This capability also protects the user's privacy. Examples are
audio, picture and video recording, biometrics (such as blood pressure) recording.
      </p>
      <p>
       We
acknowledge that user-exposed capabilities are relatively coarse-grained but
the assertion is that expanding on these levels is undesirable at this time,
for reasons previously given. Only these capabilities may be exposed to users
during software installation of unsigned code as discussed in section 3.5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Security
policies requiring Tcb and system capabilities are always mandatory. Their
strict control ensures the integrity of Symbian Trusted Computing Platform.
However the way servers check user-exposed capabilities or interpret them
may be fully flexible and even user-discretionary, for example allowing user
prompting if a sensitive action fails due to lack of capability.

Assigning capabilities to a process
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The association of a run-time
capability with a process requires a modification to Symbian executable loader
behaviour. The loader must transform the static capability settings associated
with individual executables into a run-time capability that the kernel can
use to police IPC and user/kernel interface. There are two fundamental rules
that govern the way the loader must work. They seem simple in their description
but have far-reaching security consequences as they bring to light the trust
relationship between DLLs and EXEs.

          The capabilities
of a process never change.

         There is no way of adding capabilities to

at the capability level of the process that loads it.

          A process cannot
load a DLL with less capability than itself.
         </strong>
         The need for this constraint
follows from the fact that all DLL code runs at the capability level of the
loading process and therefore must be at least as trusted at the loading process.
DLL capabilities only reflect the level of trust that the loading process
can place in them; they don’t actually authorise anything.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       What this implies is that it is the EXE that ultimately holds the
responsibility for what happens within the process which is created from it.
The capabilities allocating to the EXE grant a level of authorisation to the
process to perform its roles and responsibilities. As part of its execution,
it may use shared library code. It must not be allowed to use library code
that is less trusted than it itself is. This is expressed, in terms of capabilities,
in rule 2. However, regardless of what library code it uses, the process will
never gain authorisation to perform actions beyond those originally entrusted
to it: this is rule 1. The consequence of this is, the more capable a process,
the more restrictions will be placed on the DLLs it may load; conversely an
process with no capability is free to use any shared library on the system,
at its own discretion.

Capability Permission lifetime
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two possible alternatives
for interpretation of the presence of a user-exposed capability at capability-aware
servers:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Blanket permission
       </strong>
       : Capability is granted as a one
off act. If the capability is not present when the process is created, the
request fails. All access requiring system capability will be policed this
way. For example, the file server will just fail any clients attempting to
access functionality in the event that they don't possess this capability.
The capability would persist as long as the application is installed or until
revoked. Revocation mechanisms would be introduced in several steps as they
may require extra public key infrastructure from licensees and network operators.

         <strong>
          Single action permission
         </strong>
         :
Capability is checked upon each sensitive API call to the server. This means
that one each access to the sensitive API call, a security notifier is thrown
asking the user if they wish to grant that action. The permission only lasts
for the duration of the corresponding sensitive action.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The user perception of the kind of permission must not be confused
with when a server will check a required capability. For instance, an application
may be granted NetworkServices as blanket permission but the telephony server
will check NetworkServices capability at each relevant call made by this application.
But as the user will not be asked to make a decision (to grant or not to grant
NetworkServices for this call), this security check is transparent to the
user.

       The great majority of Symbian platform servers behave in blanket
permission mode. The reason behind this design decision is the majority of
Symbian platform servers provide low level services where the intent and the
context of an application’s requests are to some degree unknown. Therefore
it would be difficult to ask the user a question with enough understandable
information to let her make a well-informed decision.

Process Identification

      <p>
       Symbian Platform Security model is essentially
based on capability to reduce the need of identifying applications. It allows
servers to control access to their APIs without knowing their requesters and
therefore avoid the need of maintaining an access control list. However in
some circumstances, it is necessary to identify an application uniquely (see
data caging below) and even its source i.e. the vendor. To satisfy these needs
the two following concepts have been introduced.

ID to ensure that each individual SID is authorised to use that particular
Vendor ID.
      </p>
      <p>
       The SID can be explicitly specified for a particular executable
or the UID can be used instead. However those two identifiers are always different
entities in the kernel implementation. It is proposed that SIDs will come
from a specified range of UID values, and that Symbian will provide a new
mechanism to allocate suitable values.

Vendor Identifier (VID)

      </p>
      <p>
       Executables can contain a vendor identifier
that allows unique identification of the source of the executable. It is expected
that the VID will be used for genuine cases like restricting a tentative server
API from a specific vendor to its applications. While there is a potential
danger that this VID would be used for anti-competitive purposes only, we
recognise that there are enough real cases where it would be useful, and that
it would therefore be better for the platform to deliver a standard framework
rather than risking developers to implement their own solutions. To prevent
stealth of vendors’ identity, the software installer will reject the installation
of executables with VIDs delivered in an unsigned installation package.

role

      </p>
      <p>
       As for capabilities, the kernel is responsible for holding
both the application and vendor identity for each process. When a process
is created, these properties are read from the associated program, held in
kernel’s memory and are guaranteed not to change during its lifetime. However,
unlike capabilities, there is no rules model to be followed regarding shared
library. Each process is free to load shared libraries with any value of Secure
ID and Vendor ID, regardless of the identifier values in the EXE from which
the process was created. For this reason, capabilities are the core of the
security architecture; process identifiers are intended for use in tandem
with, rather than as a replacement for, capabilities.

public and can be read from and written to by any program. This allows the
use of standard file system hierarchies that may be available on removable
media. In essence, data caging involves caging processes by default into their
own small part of the file system. This means that there is default protection
of per-application and per-server data from other processes. Without data
caging, it would become necessary to introduce access control lists into the
file system to prevent rogue apps bypassing the capability model and simply
reading databases directly from files. In addition, the scheme affords further
protection against the threat of malicious replacement of executables in
       <samp class="codeph">
        /sys/bin
       </samp>
       .
In that sense, data caging is a simpler and more robust.

       Note that data caging is not a huge conceptual leap from the previous
version of the Symbian platform. Historically only the kernel had an unrestricted
view of the real machine running the Symbian platform. Each Symbian platform
process had its own view of the processor’s address space that was independent
of all other processes. This was arranged and policed by the kernel and MMU
hardware.
      </p>
      <p>
       For simplicity it has been decided that the filing system
is not aware of the meaning of “private user data”. A file cannot be flagged
as so. It is the responsibility of each process dealing with user data to
manage ReadUserData and WriteUserData capabilities. Furthermore in case of
databases, the file itself can contain user private and public data and therefore
trying to assign a level of privacy to a file is not obvious.

       Many Symbian frameworks support the concept
of plug-ins: they allow new code to contribute to existing native frameworks.
Application recognisers are a good example of such plug-ins. In order to be
identified as valid plug-ins they often provide a resource file that must
be read by process users. When the process user is unique, it makes to place
this resource file under its private directory. However, following the rules
previously stated that should be impossible. To conciliate both points of
view without compromising security, the rules described below have been defined:

      <p>
       To help share data across processes, current operating
system features have been enhanced and new ones have been implemented. File
handles and memory chunks can be shared between processes. These methods can
be used to get temporary access to a specific file or memory area that is
otherwise private. The recipient of the shared handle will only be able to
use the file in the mode chosen by the file opener. Also a highly efficient
public &amp; subscribe service has been implemented to enable secure asynchronous,
fast distribution of data.

Removable media

      <p>
       Executables installed by the device on removable
media will be hashed. This hash as well as the executable’s capability set
are securely stored on the device. At load time, the loader verifies the hash
before accepting to perform the operation. If the verification fails, the
executable will not be loaded. If the executable is unknown (no associated
hash), the executable is loaded without any capability and its SID and VID
are assigned to unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although it is out of the scope of Symbian
Secure Architecture, some hardware features can increase the level of security
of removable media when off the device. For instance, a password-protected
card will prevent a desktop rogue application to get or modify information
stored on card without the consent of the user.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result Symbian
Secure Architecture does not guarantee integrity and confidentiality of files
stored under ‘/private’ and /resource when off the device. Each program should
decide what integrity checks are appropriate and what level of confidentiality
they may provide.

Software validation

      <p>
       A SIS file may contain zero or more signatures,
and the set of capabilities that it needs. The software installer verifies
each signature and constructs a certificate chain back to a trusted root.
A configuration setting controls whether the software installer will check
the revocation status of the certificate using OCSP. In addition, it is possible
to mark SW Install root certificates as 'mandatory' certificates. If a mandatory
certificate exists, then all installable packages must be signed with it,
or installation fails. This enables the holder of the associated key to hold
a 'veto' over what software may be installed.

      <p>
       Each SW Install root certificate is associated
with a set of the capabilities that it is allowed to grant, called ‘meta-capabilities’.
The installer calculates the largest set of capabilities that the installable
may be granted as the union of the meta-capabilities associated with all successfully
validated signatures.
      </p>
      <p>
       A configuration setting determines which additional
capabilities the user is allowed to grant if the set of permitted capabilities
is less than the capabilities requested in the SIS file.The installer will
never install software with less than its requested set of capabilities: it
is either installed with all of them, or it is not installed at all.

      <p>
       At
product build time, all configuration settings may be freely determined. In
the field configuration settings may be altered to a more limited degree.
For instance, the device manufacturer may decide or not to let the user the
freedom to grant some capabilities at install time. It should be noted that
a key feature of the scheme is that install packages don’t necessarily have
to be signed in order to be installed and granted capabilities. This is something
that OEMs may not want to permit but at least we provide the option should
the system integrator (manufacturer or potentially network operator) want
to permit such an installation option. This might be an attractive option
for developers wishing to avoid the hassle of code signing.

       Symbian is primarily concerned with the integrity

and also on the host once backed-up, is out of the scope of the Symbian Security
Architecture described in this document.

needs to consider three different types of files in the context of backup
and restore.

         <em>

      <p>
       A process that owns private data
and wants to use active backup and restore has to be able to provide all of
the data that they wish to backup, and has to be able to receive the data
for restore. In order to minimise the code and maintenance overheads, a standard
set of reference functions will be provided in the OS that externalise from
a directory tree and internalise to a directory tree. A process using active
backup should use these functions to externalise its data on a stream for
backup and signal when it has finished. For restoration it will internalise
from a similar stream. The functions provided should be adequate for most
data owning processes. Any processes which want more selective access will
have to implement their own functions.

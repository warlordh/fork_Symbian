       Application Structure
      </h2>
      <p>
       Carbide.c++ offers two ways
of exploring your project. The traditional
       <strong>
        Project Explorer
       </strong>
       window, which can also be found in Eclipse, lists the files belonging
to the project in the same directory structure as in the file system.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <strong>
        Symbian Project Navigator
       </strong>
       contains the same contents,
but displays them in a logical hierarchy according to
       <a href="http://developer.symbian.org/wiki/index.php/Coding_Standards_and_Conventions" target="_blank">
        Symbian Conventions
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       You might wonder
why a basic "Hello World" application contains so many files. The
answer is straightforward - a much simpler Hello World wouldnâ€™t be
a very good starting point for real-world applications.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead
the wizard generates the project for a complete and readily extensible
application. The project separates code and data, and uses a form
of the
       <a href="http://wiki.forum.nokia.com/index.php/Design_Patterns_in_Symbian#Model-View-Control_Pattern" target="_blank">
        model view controller pattern
       </a>
       for structuring
your code. The application already reacts to system events and contains
everything that is required for localization.

       Extending
Hello World â€“ Drawing
      </h2>
      <p>
       To make our application a little bit
more interactive, we are going to implement a simple paint tool, allowing
the user to draw lines by touching the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
       We could
draw the lines directly on the screen, but then everything would get
lost when something caused our application to redraw the screen â€“
for example, a telephone call that came through while our application
was running. Therefore, we have to draw the lines to a bitmap, which
is simply copied to the screen whenever required.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another
solution (more difficult but also more flexible!) would be to store
all lines in a list and to iterate over the list each time the application
needs to draw the contents of the screen.

       Creating
Bitmaps
      </h2>
      <p>
       Now the libraries have been added, we can use the
bitmap classes in our project. Open the file
       <samp class="codeph">
        HelloWorldContainer.h
       </samp>
       and add the following include statements:
      </p>
      <pre class="codeblock">
       #include &lt;fbs.h&gt;
#include &lt;bitdev.h&gt;
#include &lt;bitstd.h&gt;
      </pre>
      <p>
       We also need to store the bitmap objects as instance
(member) variables. Add the following definitions to a private section
of the
       <samp class="codeph">
        CHelloWorldContainer
       </samp>
       class. Be careful not
to write anything into areas managed by the UI designer, because your
changes could be overwritten. These areas are marked by comments.
      </p>
      <pre class="codeblock">
       private:  
CFbsBitmap* iBitmap;  
CFbsBitmapDevice* iBmpDevice;  
CFbsBitGc* iBmpGc;
      </pre>
      <p>
       Symbian C++ uses some
       <a href="http://developer.symbian.org/wiki/index.php/Coding_Standards_and_Conventions#Naming_Conventions" target="_blank">
        naming conventions
       </a>
       . Instance variables should
have a lowercase
       <samp class="codeph">
        i
       </samp>
       at the beginning of the variable
name (
       <samp class="codeph">
        iBitmap
       </samp>
       ). Arguments should be marked by an
a (
       <samp class="codeph">
        aBitmap
       </samp>
       ). Normal local variables that you create
inside a function do not need any prefix. That way, you instantly
know where the variable is coming from â€“ this is very important when
deleting objects.    Next, we want to create the bitmap. Define and
implement a new method:
      </p>
      <samp class="codeph">
       void CHelloWorldContainer::CreateBitmapsL()
      </samp>
      <p>
       Letâ€™s go line by line through the required code for this method:
   First, we have to make sure that any previous objects are deleted
if they already exist. This would be required (for example) if the
running application needs to re-create the bitmap because the screen
layout changes. You donâ€™t need to add an if statement to check if
the pointer is NULL beforehand â€“ the C++
       <samp class="codeph">
        delete
       </samp>
       statement
only deletes the object if the pointer is not NULL. You do however
need to ensure that the objects are set to NULL after deletion to
avoid possible "double deletion" in the destructor.
      </p>
      <pre class="codeblock">
       delete iBitmap; iBitmap = NULL;  
delete iBmpDevice; iBmpDevice = NULL;  
delete iBmpGc; iBmpGc = NULL;
      </pre>
      <p>
       This following line of
code should look familiar â€“ it simply creates an instance of the
       <samp class="codeph">
        CFbsBitmap
       </samp>
       class:
      </p>
      <p>
       <samp class="codeph">
        iBitmap = new (ELeave)
CFbsBitmap();
       </samp>
      </p>
      <p>
       The (
       <samp class="codeph">
        ELeave
       </samp>
       )
parameter is Symbian C++ specific. This causes a
       <a href="http://developer.symbian.org/wiki/index.php/Leaves_%26_The_Cleanup_Stack_(Fundamentals_of_Symbian_C%2B%2B)" target="_blank">
        leave
       </a>
       (the Symbian C++ equivalent of standard
exceptions) if allocating the object fails â€“ for example, because
there is not enough free memory. With the (
       <samp class="codeph">
        ELeave
       </samp>
       ), you donâ€™t have to manually check if the pointer is actually pointing
to a valid object after creating the object instance. You can find
out more about leaves in
       <a href="http://developer.symbian.org/wiki/index.php/Fundamentals_of_Symbian_C%2B%2B" target="_blank">
        Fundamentals of C++
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       We do not handle
the potential leave here; thatâ€™s why the method name (
       <samp class="codeph">
        CreateBitmapL()
       </samp>
       ) has a trailing L to show that it can also leave. More on this topic
in a moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, itâ€™s time to let the
       <samp class="codeph">
        CFbsBitmap
       </samp>
       class allocate the memory for the bitmap it is going to manage.
The available drawing size for our container can be queried by the
method
       <samp class="codeph">
        Size()
       </samp>
       from its base class.
       <samp class="codeph">
        EColor16MU
       </samp>
       specifies the color depth â€“ in this case, itâ€™s a true color display
mode with 32 bits per pixel; the top byte is unused. The color mode
       <samp class="codeph">
        EColor16MA
       </samp>
       would use the top byte for the alpha channel,
several other modes are available as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       <samp class="codeph">
        iBitmap-&gt;Create(Size(),
EColor16MU);
       </samp>
      </p>
      <p>
       The next line creates a graphics device
based on the bitmap. A graphics device represents the medium being
drawn to and is needed to create a graphics context. The use of a
       <samp class="codeph">
        NewL()
       </samp>
       method is common in Symbian C++; it is a static factory
function which returns a fully constructed object of the desired type.
      </p>
      <p>
       <samp class="codeph">
        iBmpDevice = CFbsBitmapDevice::NewL(iBitmap);
       </samp>
      </p>
      <p>
       A graphics context provides a large number of drawing
operations, along with state settings defining how the drawing is
performed. The bitmap graphics context used here is a specialization
of the generic graphics context and adds some methods that can be
used for bitmaps only â€“ such as clearing and copying rectangular areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       <samp class="codeph">
        iBmpDevice-&gt;CreateContext(iBmpGc);
       </samp>
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever you create objects, itâ€™s best to think about where and
when they are going to be deleted right away. Memory leaks are a serious
issue on a mobile device where no virtual memory is available and
the main memory is limited to 30-80 MB. Therefore, go to the destructor
of
       <samp class="codeph">
        CHelloWorldContainer
       </samp>
       and add the required statements
for deleting the three objects:
      </p>
      <div class="p">
       <pre class="codeblock">
        delete iBmpGc;  
delete iBmpDevice;  
delete iBitmap;
       </pre>
      </div>
      <p>
       The next step addresses the
remaining question: where to call the
       <samp class="codeph">
        CreateBitmapsL()
       </samp>
       method. Of course, you could do this from the construction methods
of the class. But what if, while your application is running, the
user physically turns the phone, causing it to switch from portrait
to landscape mode? Because the bitmap was created with the portrait
size in mind, the user would no longer be able to use the full screen
for drawing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, we have to react to events that
inform us when the screen size is changed. In those situations,
       <samp class="codeph">
        SizeChanged()
       </samp>
       is executed. When the container is first constructed,
its size changes as well. Because of this, we can simply call our
       <samp class="codeph">
        CreateBitmapsL()
       </samp>
       method from within
       <samp class="codeph">
        SizeChanged()
       </samp>
       :
      </p>
      <div class="p">
       <pre class="codeblock">
        void CHelloWorldContainer::SizeChanged()  
	{  
	CCoeControl::SizeChanged();  
	LayoutControls();     
	// [[[ begin generated region: do not modify [Generated Contents]
	// ]]] end generated region [Generated Contents]
	if (!iBitmap || (iBitmap &amp;&amp; iBitmap-&gt;SizeInPixels() != Size()))
		{
		TRAPD(err, CreateBitmapsL());
		}
	}
       </pre>
      </div>
      <p>
       In the source code above, an additional
check ensures that the bitmap is only re-created if the size available
for the container is really different to the existing bitmap size
â€“ the
       <samp class="codeph">
        SizeChanged()
       </samp>
       method is also called, for example,
when the option menu obscures part of our view. This does not affect
the available space for our drawing area and therefore should not
lead to re-creating the bitmap.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what is the
       <samp class="codeph">
        TRAPD()
       </samp>
       statement doing here? Letâ€™s use this to take a closer
look at the concept of leaves.
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Leaves
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       When
programming using Symbian C++, an L is appended to the name of methods
that can leave (usually because it contains other methods that can
leave and does not choose to "TRAP" them). Note: this is a helpful
convention, but is not checked or required by the compiler.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our
       <samp class="codeph">
        CreateBitmapsL()
       </samp>
       method contains two methods
that can leave: the (
       <samp class="codeph">
        ELeave
       </samp>
       ) parameter causes a leave
if there is not enough memory to allocate the object. The
       <samp class="codeph">
        NewL()
       </samp>
       method from the graphics device also has a trailing
       <samp class="codeph">
        L
       </samp>
       â€“ meaning that this method can also leave. We did not
catch any (all) of those leaves in the
       <samp class="codeph">
        CreateBitmapsL()
       </samp>
       method so it was named with a trailing
       <samp class="codeph">
        L
       </samp>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Any leaves are passed up in the call stack until caught by a
       <samp class="codeph">
        TRAPD
       </samp>
       macro. The
       <samp class="codeph">
        SizeChanged()
       </samp>
       method traps
any leaves from
       <samp class="codeph">
        CreateBitmapsL()
       </samp>
       and consequently
does
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       need to have a trailing
       <samp class="codeph">
        L
       </samp>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The error code of the leave is stored in the err variable, which
is declared as a normal integer by this macro. It would be a good
idea to take a look at the contents of this variable and to handle
errors instead of ignoring them as weâ€™re doing here. But for the sake
of simplicity, we do not handle any errors that might occur in this
situation.

       A good way to automatically
check your code for potential problems is to use the
       <em>
        CodeScanner

       tool that comes with Carbide.c++. It is a static code-analysis tool
looking at Symbian coding rules and standards. Find out more at:

       Handling
Touch Events
      </h2>
      <div class="p">
       Before we start handling the touch events,
we need one more instance variable in our code. To draw a line from
one touch position to the next, itâ€™s necessary to save the first position.
Therefore, add the following private instance variable to
       <samp class="codeph">
        CHelloWorldContainer
       </samp>
       :
       <pre class="codeblock">
        TPoint iLastPos;
       </pre>
      </div>
      <p>
       <samp class="codeph">
        TPoint
       </samp>
       is a convenience class that stores
two integers that can be used as co-ordinates. Additionally, it provides
some methods to modify the point. We do not need to initialize the
variable in the constructor of the
       <samp class="codeph">
        CHelloWorldContainer
       </samp>
       class â€“ the container class is indirectly derived from the class
       <samp class="codeph">
        CBase
       </samp>
       , which automatically zero-initializes all member variables.
   Touch events are delivered to the container class, which is responsible
for managing the visible UI content in the main pane of your application.
To handle the events ourselves, we have to override the following
method in
       <samp class="codeph">
        CHelloWorldContainer
       </samp>
       :
      </p>
      <p>
       <samp class="codeph">
        void
CHelloWorldContainer::HandlePointerEventL(const TPointerEvent&amp;
aPointerEvent)
       </samp>
      </p>
      <div class="p">
       Define this method in the header file
(can be private or protected) and add its implementation in the
       <samp class="codeph">
        .cpp
       </samp>
       file.    The information about the new event is sent
through the argument
       <samp class="codeph">
        aPointerEvent
       </samp>
       . We are interested
in the up event for the first button (there is only one in current
touch devices; you canâ€™t click with a right button as you would with
a mouse). Whenever the user releases the stylus or finger from the
touch screen, we want to draw a line to this position. Put the following
code into this if statement:
       <pre class="codeblock">
        if (aPointerEvent.iType == TPointerEvent::EButton1Up)
  {
  }
       </pre>
      </div>
      <p>
       Drawing the line itself is rather simple. First,
define the color and style that should be used for drawing, then call
the function for drawing the line. Note that the settings concerning
the color and style stay active until they are changed again in this
graphics context â€“ you do not need to set them every time when executing
consecutive drawing operations.
      </p>
      <pre class="codeblock">
       iBmpGc-&gt;SetPenColor(KRgbRed);  
iBmpGc-&gt;SetPenSize(TSize(2,2));  
iBmpGc-&gt;DrawLine(iLastPos, aPointerEvent.iPosition);
      </pre>
      <p>
       Next, we have to save the new position, because it will be required
as the starting point for the next line.
      </p>
      <samp class="codeph">
       iLastPos = aPointerEvent.iPosition;
      </samp>
      <p>
       Finally, issue a request to the framework to redraw the screen.
Otherwise, the user wonâ€™t see the new line!
      </p>
      <samp class="codeph">
       DrawDeferred();
      </samp>
      <p>
       At the end of the method, also call the
       <samp class="codeph">
        HandlePointerEventL()
       </samp>
       method of the base class (the container is derived from
       <samp class="codeph">
        CCoeControl
       </samp>
       , because it is a normal UI control by itself):
      </p>
      <samp class="codeph">
       CCoeControl::HandlePointerEventL(aPointerEvent);
      </samp>
      <p>
       To sum it up, this is the final code for the
       <samp class="codeph">
        HandlePointerEvent()
       </samp>
       method:
      </p>
      <pre class="codeblock">
       void CHelloWorldContainer::HandlePointerEventL(const TPointerEvent&amp; aPointerEvent)
    {
    if (aPointerEvent.iType == TPointerEvent::EButton1Up)
      {
      iBmpGc-&gt;SetPenColor(KRgbRed);
      iBmpGc-&gt;SetPenSize(TSize(2,2));
      iBmpGc-&gt;DrawLine(iLastPos, aPointerEvent.iPosition);
      iLastPos = aPointerEvent.iPosition;
      DrawDeferred();
      }
    CCoeControl::HandlePointerEventL(aPointerEvent);
    }
      </pre>
      <p>
       Weâ€™ve already added all the code required for
drawing to the bitmap, but this bitmap still has to be transferred
to the screen. The
       <samp class="codeph">
        CHelloWorldContainer::Draw()
       </samp>
       method
is called when the system wants the contents of the container to be
redrawn. Therefore, we need to add the following line of code to the
end of the
       <samp class="codeph">
        Draw()
       </samp>
       method, which copies the bitmap
to the top left of the graphics context of the screen:
      </p>
      <samp class="codeph">
       gc.BitBlt(TPoint(0, 0), iBitmap);
      </samp>
      <p>
       Now compile the project.
It should already work â€“ you can draw red lines by just clicking inside
the main pane of the emulator!

       (this is available in the drop-down
list). This command will also be sent to your application if the operating
system wants to shut it down, for example, when the phone does not
have enough memory left. Therefore, it is necessary that every application
always responds to this event and instantly shuts the application
down. It is already handled by the basic application that the Carbide.c++
wizard generated for you; you donâ€™t need to implement the command
handling for this event yourself.

       When testing
the application, always quit your application using the

        Exit
       </strong>
       command (rather than just closing the emulator). The application
environment will then automatically check for memory leaks. If you
just shut down the emulator you may not discover the leak until much
later, making it a lot more difficult to find the cause.

       Clearing
the Drawing
      </h2>
      <p>
       Whenever the
       <strong>
        Clear

       menu item is selected
the view class method
       <samp class="codeph">
        CHelloWorldContainerView::HandleCommandL()
       </samp>
       is called with the command ID of the menu item as a parameter.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we want to handle the menu item, the UI designer can create
the necessary code for us. Right-click on the menu item and choose
       <strong>
        Handle â€˜selectedâ€™ Event
       </strong>
       . The UI designer will ask you to save
the design â€“ choose
       <strong>
        Yes
       </strong>
       . The code will then be generated and
you will jump into the code view to a new method called
       <samp class="codeph">
        HandleClearMenuItemSelectedL()
       </samp>
       â€“ a more convenient place to put your command-handling code than
directly in a big
       <samp class="codeph">
        HandleCommandL()
       </samp>
       method that receives
all commands. The auto-generated source code therefore calls the new
extra method from within
       <samp class="codeph">
        HandleCommandL()
       </samp>
       (take a
look at that method to see what really happens).

      <p>
       Now, we only need to tell the container that it should clear
its bitmap buffer. To do this, create a new public method in the container:
      </p>
      <pre class="codeblock">
       void CHelloWorldContainer::ClearDrawing()
  {
  iBmpGc-&gt;Clear();
  DrawDeferred();
  }
      </pre>
      <p>
       Now, call this method from the menu item handler
method. As explained in the section about the application architecture,
the view class (
       <samp class="codeph">
        CHelloWorldContainerView
       </samp>
       ) is the
controller and owner for/of the container class (
       <samp class="codeph">
        CHelloWorldContainer
       </samp>
       ). Therefore, this class has a pointer to the container as an instance
variable, which you can use to clear the drawing.
      </p>
      <pre class="codeblock">
       TBool CHelloWorldContainerView::HandleClearMenuItemSelectedL(TInt aCommand)
  {
  iHelloWorldContainer-&gt;ClearDrawing();
  return ETrue;
  }
      </pre>
      <p>
       The menu command should now clear the image.

       Further
Exercises
      </h2>
      <p>
       As an exercise, itâ€™s a good idea to extend the
application by yourself â€“ for example, you could add some menu items
that allow the end user to change the color of the pen.
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Tip
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Itâ€™s a good idea to learn keyboard shortcuts
as early as possible, because they can significantly increase the
efficiency of your work. For example, you can press
       <strong>
        Ctrl + B
       </strong>
       to build the project, instead of using the icon or the menu commands.
Also very helpful:
       <strong>
        Ctrl + Shift + F
       </strong>
       automatically formats and
indents your code. You can get a full list of commands by pressing
       <strong>
        Ctrl + 3
       </strong>
       . A hot keys list appears when you press
       <strong>
        Ctrl + Shift
+ L
       </strong>
       .

       In the following step, select which SDKs you would like to
use. The same considerations as those explained when creating your
Hello World application apply.

       You can usually accept the default values for the next step
and let the wizard import everything.

       In the last step,
you have to define the
       <strong>
        Project Properties
       </strong>
       . In most cases, you
can leave the default values.

       Afterwards, the project is imported and you can start working.
The project contents will not be copied to the current Carbide.c++
workspace, so you will work directly on the original directory and
the original files. Copy the project to a different directory first
if you want to keep the original project or example in its original
state â€“ for example, into the workspace directory.

        Troubleshooting

       : If
       <span class="keyword">
        importing
       </span>
       the project fails, take special
care of the last step of the import process: the root directory should
be set correctly to the root directory of the project and not one
level above it. Also, the project name should be the same as the last
part of the root directory. From time to time, the default values
are not configured properly, causing problems in the import process.
      </p>

      <p>
       <strong>
        Warning
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Do not use the standard (Eclipse)
project import! The reason is that this import method would also import
all build configuration settings, including references to installed
SDKs and paths on the original system. Therefore, if you import a
project from somebody else but donâ€™t have the SDK installed in exactly
the same directory, the build configurations will no longer work.
The
       <samp class="codeph">
        bld.inf
       </samp>
       import method recreates the SDK bindings
and only imports the real contents of the project.
